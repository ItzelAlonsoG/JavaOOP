# Introduction

The master of OOP programing is Java, there are some of the fundamental information you need to know to understand this repository:

- **Variables** 
   Are very simple elementary entities, they can be numbers, characters, Booleans, among others.
- **Objects** 
   Are complex entities that can be formed by the grouping of different variables and methods.
 
- **Static Classes**
  Do not need to be instantiated in order to be called and executed, although you must remember that they only allow calling the static methods of their parent classes.
  
- **Inheritance**
  We can define inheritance as the ability to create classes that automatically acquire the members (attributes and methods) of other classes that already exist, while being able to add their own attributes and methods.
  
- **Polymorphism**
  Is a feature of object-oriented programming that consists of overriding some methods of the class from which our subclasses inherit to assign different behaviors.
  
- **Abstraction**
Abstraction It is the pillar of OOP, which allows identifying the characteristics and behaviors of an object and with which the class (template) will be built. This means that through this pillar or foundation it is possible to recognize the attributes and methods of an object. 

 - **Encapsulation**
  It is the characteristic of OOP that allows hiding the complexity of the code, it belongs to the private part of the class and it cannot be seen from any other program
  
- **Override**
  Constructor override consists of using the inherited members of a superclass but with different arguments.
When a class inherits another and in this child class a method is redefined with an implementation different from that of the parent class.

- **Interfaces**
  Interfaces are a type of reference similar to a class with only constants and method definitions, they are of great help to define behaviors that are redundant and we want to reuse more than one class, even when we have many classes and not all of them belong to the same "family".
  
- **Abstract Methods**
  The Abstract Methods are the methods that we must implement every time we use our abstract classes, while the non-abstract methods will be optional.
  
- **Anonymous Classes**
  Anonymous Classes are a way to instantiate abstract classes without using their child classes. But this type of instantiation has some restrictions: the life cycle of these instances is NOT long-lasting, we will not have them available during the entire execution of the program.
